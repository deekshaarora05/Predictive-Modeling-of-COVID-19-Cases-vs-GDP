# Predictive-Modeling-of-COVID-19-Cases-vs-GDP
This repository contains a detailed analysis of COVID'19 on GDP of a country. To carry out the analysis, I generated models for long term and short term 
prediction of COVID’19 active cases and death cases and predicted the GDP of a country by correlating it with COVID’19 active cases and some other latent factors which don't
affect the GDP of a country in a very direct fashion.
